# utils/

Shared helper functions. Any helper needed in more than one translation unit goes here — Architecture Rule 1.

## Files

- `radioutils.{cpp,h}` — `RadioUtils::` namespace. Frequency → band (11 bands + gaps), band edges, tuning step tables, span-dial stepping with K4 quirks.

## Rule 1 — No duplicated static functions

If you catch yourself copy-pasting a helper into a second `.cpp` file, promote it to `utils/` with a namespace. Copy-pasting is a defect; fix it immediately.

## Shape

Each utility is a free function or small namespace. Zero state, zero side effects, zero dependencies on Qt UI types.
